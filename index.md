## About myself

Hello people. This is **Asher James**. I am a second year undergraduate studying in the * *University of California, San Diego* *. 

I am ~~absolutely~~ absolutely not looking forward to this quarter. My scheduled is stacked and I am thinking about dropping some classes. But as a wise man once said,:

> You gotta deal with it, son. 
I really don't know who said this quote.

## Some code I just written in CSE 100

This is the code-snippet of something I written in CSE 100.

```
void FancyOutputStream::write_bit(int bit) {
    // crash if invalid input
    if(bit != 0 && bit != 1) {
        error("Trying to write invalid bit");
    }
    ........
}
```
